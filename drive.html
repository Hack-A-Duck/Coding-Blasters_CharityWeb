            The education officer said that the girls had to drop out for reasons like lack of awareness about menstruation, post-puberty changes in the body, and security concerns. Many girls drop out of school altogether once they begin menstruating. Should young women miss twenty percent of school days in a given year due to a lack of facilities or a lack of information or a lack of sanitary products?

          <p>The fact is quite strange that in spite of the number of reported incidents of female infanticide, child abuse, and disgraceful acts against women, the number of girl children adopted in India is much more than of boys, in the last three years.
          Education is a step by step process of gaining knowledge the aim of education is to bring changes not only in the amount of knowledge gained but also in the abilities to think and to acquire habits, skills, and attitude which characterize an individual who is socially accepted and adjusted. However, only bookish knowledge does not serve the purpose of wisdom enhancement especially when our children are dealing with unnecessary stress of poverty, stress, hunger, and exploitation.
          You can help poor children to complete their dreams. Giving them your precious time and a little bit of care. We go to the slum area and arrange workshops for the children to teach them drawing, painting, and all other extracurricular activities.</p><br>

            are just looking for a handout, people who don‚Äôt want to work, but, sadly, that is not true.
            Over one-third of our hungry people are innocent children who are members of households‚Ä¶
